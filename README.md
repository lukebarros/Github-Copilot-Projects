# Github copilot testing

In this repository, you can find code that I've written to help me test my Github copilot. 
And the previous sentence was written entirely by it.

**Not a single line of code was written by me besides the initial comment line.**

For now they're mostly just basic APIs but I intend on uploading more diverse examples in the future.
